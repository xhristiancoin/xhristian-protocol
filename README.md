# XHRISTIAN Protocol Documentation

This repository contains the technical and structural documentation for the $XHRISTIAN project.

It serves as the canonical reference for contract-related information, token supply details, and on-chain verification materials once the project is live.

---

## Pre-Launch Status

The $XHRISTIAN token has not yet been deployed at the time of this writing.

This repository currently documents:
- Intended documentation structure
- Disclosure standards for post-launch verification
- Principles guiding how on-chain information will be published

All contract addresses, final supply figures, and verification references will be added here after deployment.

---

## Scope

Post-launch, this repository will include:
- Official contract address
- Token supply and distribution references
- On-chain verification links
- Any immutable or publicly verifiable protocol details

No economic mechanisms or utility features are implemented or implied at this stage.

---

## Transparency

All updates to this repository are made publicly and are intended to provide clear, verifiable references for the project as it exists on-chain.
